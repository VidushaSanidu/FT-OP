# DO-TP Framework Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Implemented

I have completely restructured and enhanced your DO-TP codebase with proper modularity and comprehensive functionality. Here's what's been implemented:

### 🏗️ **Modular Architecture**

#### **1. Configuration Management (`src/config.py`)**

- Dataclass-based configuration system
- Separate configs for model, training, federated learning, data, and output
- Easy parameter management and experiment reproducibility
- Support for centralized, federated, and comparison configurations

#### **2. Core Modules (`src/core/`)**

- **`training.py`**: Reusable training utilities with early stopping, metrics tracking, and model management
- **`data_manager.py`**: Flexible data loading for both centralized and federated scenarios
- **`federated.py`**: Complete federated learning implementation with weighted aggregation
- **`evaluation.py`**: Comprehensive model evaluation, comparison, and visualization tools

### 🚀 **Training Implementations**

#### **1. Centralized Training (`src/train_centralized.py`)**

- **Purpose**: Train on ALL specified datasets combined, validate on ONE dataset
- **Features**:
  - Uses all training datasets simultaneously
  - Validates on a designated dataset (configurable)
  - Early stopping to prevent overfitting
  - Best model checkpointing
  - Comprehensive metrics tracking (ADE, FDE, Loss)
  - Training progress visualization

#### **2. Federated Training (`src/train_federated_new.py`)**

- **Purpose**: Federated learning where each dataset is a client
- **Features**:
  - Each dataset acts as a federated client
  - Weighted aggregation based on client data sizes
  - Configurable global rounds and local epochs
  - Round-by-round validation
  - Support for different aggregation methods (weighted_avg, simple_avg)
  - Client statistics tracking

#### **3. Model Comparison (`src/compare_models.py`)**

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive comparison between centralized and federated models
- **Features**:
  - Evaluates both models on multiple test datasets
  - Performance comparison (ADE, FDE, Loss)
  - Training efficiency analysis
  - Rich visualization and reporting
  - Statistical summaries

### 📊 **What Each Script Does**

#### **Centralized Training Workflow:**

1. **Data Loading**: Combines all specified training datasets into one large dataset
2. **Training**: Trains the DO-TP model on the combined dataset
3. **Validation**: Validates on the specified validation dataset
4. **Output**: Best model, metrics, training curves, logs

#### **Federated Training Workflow:**

1. **Client Setup**: Each dataset becomes a federated client
2. **Global Rounds**: For each round:
   - Select clients for training
   - Each client trains locally for specified epochs
   - Aggregate client updates using weighted averaging
   - Validate global model
3. **Output**: Final federated model, round checkpoints, metrics, logs

#### **Comparison Workflow:**

1. **Model Loading**: Loads both centralized and federated models
2. **Evaluation**: Tests both models on all specified test datasets
3. **Analysis**: Compares performance, training efficiency, convergence
4. **Visualization**: Creates comparison plots and summary reports

### 🛠️ **Easy-to-Use Scripts**

#### **Shell Scripts (`scripts/`)**

- **`run_centralized.sh`**: Easy centralized training with customizable parameters
- **`run_federated.sh`**: Easy federated training with full configuration
- **`compare_models.sh`**: Model comparison with visualization
- **`run_complete_experiment.sh`**: Complete pipeline (centralized + federated + comparison)

#### **Setup and Validation**

- **`setup.sh`**: Validates environment, dependencies, and dataset structure
